      <h2>Information Automatically Collected</h2>
      <p>
        In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services.

This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

      <h2>Facebook Login</h2>
      <p>
        We offer you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook logins).

The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

          <li>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</li>
        </ul>


      <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.

      </p>

      <h2>Keeping Your Information Safe</h2>
      <p>
        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.
      </p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at nickr964@gmail.com.
